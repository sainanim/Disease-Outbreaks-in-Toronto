# Disease-Outbreaks-in-Toronto

In accordance with the Ontario Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA), healthcare institutions such as hospitals, long-term care homes, and retirement homes have an obligation to actively monitor both staff and patients/residents for indications of gastroenteric (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever) and respiratory (e.g., cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever) infections. These institutions are further mandated to proactively identify, assess, and report suspected and/or confirmed outbreaks to their respective local public health units. An outbreak, as defined under the HPPA, signifies a localized surge (e.g., within an institution, or a specific ward or floor) in the incidence of infection or illness that exceeds the anticipated levels.

Under the HPPA, Toronto Public Health is mandated to promptly address notifications of suspected and confirmed outbreaks related to gastroenteric and respiratory illnesses. Collaborating closely with healthcare institutions, Toronto Public Health endeavors to prevent and manage institutional outbreaks through the implementation of optimal infection prevention and control measures based on best practices.
